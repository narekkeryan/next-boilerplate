This is [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) Application Boilerplate which includes User Registration, User Login, User Logout and Profile pages.

Registration and Login are functioning when it's connected to corresponding api backend. For that you can use one of this:
* [Express Rest Boilerplate](https://github.com/narekkeryan/express-rest-boilerplate)
* [Koa Rest Boilerplate](https://github.com/narekkeryan/koa-rest-boilerplate)

To change the way Register and Login functions you need to change ```/utils/AuthService.js``` and also ```/utils/withAuth.js``` and ```/utils/withoutAuth.js``` files.

For styling application I have used [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) with help of [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/). For custom styles I have used [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/).
